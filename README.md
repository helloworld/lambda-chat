Application Features:
- Supports channels for parallel conversations
- \slashcommands -> for enhanced messaging features.

Development Features: 
- Uses [yesod-websockets](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/yesod-websockets) to allow realtime, low-latency communication
- Written in ES6, transpiled using Babel (https://babeljs.io/)

To clone and install dependencies, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/helloworld/lambda-chat
stack install
```

To run development server: 
```sh
